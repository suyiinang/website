This Tableau How To section was created to document my learning journey with Tableau.

Majority of these visualisations were created during the Visual Analytics class of [MITB](https://scis.smu.edu.sg/master-it-business), and recreated in my free time for my learning purpose.  

I would like to thank [Prof Kam of Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg/faculty/profile/9618/KAM-Tin-Seong) for the inspiration.
